## Analysis of MTA ridership and Median Property Value during COVID-19 Pandemic

The goal of this project is explore and analyze how the COVID-19 Pandemic affected ridership levels in different parts of the neighborhood in NYC. Specifically, the D train line and how ridership levels changed in relation with the median property value in those neighborhoods.

To start exploring the goal, I wanted to look at the relationship between pre-pandemic and post-pandemic entries levels.

I used a scatter plot just to check out the difference in entries. At first it may not be noticable but if you look at the Y-axis the scale in difference is huge.

I also quickly plotted the median property value just to check which area had the highest value in property.

It is obvious that the number of ridership has fell drastically after the pandemic.
