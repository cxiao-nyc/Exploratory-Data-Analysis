    "\n",
    "COVID-19 impacted the every day lives of New Yorkers. To the way we eat, shop and interact with one another. New Yorkers weren't just the only ones being impacted. One of the largest transit systems in the world, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (`MTA`) had a massive dip in passengers. I will be exploring the neighborhood's economical status and their impact on MTA ridership."

Having to commute far for work during the pandemic must have been hard and the Mayor wants to give back to the community. The Mayor wants to know which neighborhoods had the most number of people using the subway to commute during the pandemic."
