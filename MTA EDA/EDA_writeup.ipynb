    "For this project, my goal was to see the impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on New York City's MTA ridership. The main chunk of this project will be exploring ridership levels pre-COVID and during COVID. I will also be taking New York City's neighborhood's property value status into consideration to see how it certain neighborhoods affected ridership levels. After cleaning my data, I wanted to see the connection between the ridership activities in with median property values. To do so, I built graphs and plots to analyze my findings. "

    "A committee of legislatives wants to give back to New York City's community after the pandemic.

    "To tackle this project, I used [MTA turnstiles](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html) dataset to see which stations that had the least change in ridership activities. To explore more into the changes, I measured affluency by looking at each [neighborhoods](https://streeteasy.com/blog/data-dashboard/) median property values. I wanted to see if more affluent neighborhoods had a more dramatic decrease in ridership levels compared to less affluent neighborhoods.  I also wanted to explore the changes for each individual station. \n"
